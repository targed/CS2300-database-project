When personnel must enter SCP-173's container, no fewer than 3 may enter at any time and the door is to be relocked behind them.

The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Line of sight must not be broken at any time with SCP-173. Personnel assigned to enter container are instructed to alert one another before blinking. Object is reported to attack by snapping the neck at the base of the skull, or by strangulation.
